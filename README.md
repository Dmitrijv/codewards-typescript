# Codewars - JavaScript

Codewars is a community of developers that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

## Kata

Kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some of these challenges train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.
